## Contributing

Run the project locally:

`live-server --verbose --ignore README.md .`

This will open a browser with live reload, and then you can change stuff and see it.

live-server is Node app available from npm; use `npm install -g live-server` to get it

The `--verbose` means to print requests as they come in, this is nice

The `--ignore README.md` prevents changes to this file from triggering reload blahdeblah.
